## · Please describe the differences between IAAS, PAAS and SAAS and give examples of each in a cloud platform of your choosing?
IAAS - Infrastructure-as-a-Service - all the layers in a cloud platform that are related to hardware, networking infrastructure, storage capabilities, virtualization and managed by the cloud provider. With IAAS customer needs to manage the platform layer, applications and data. Examples in Azure: Azure VMs, Azure Load Balancer, Azure VNETs.
PAAS - Platform-as-a-service - cloud provider manages infrastructure (networking, hardware, virtualization) and the platform layer (operating system, middleware and runtime). Customer manages software - applications and data. Examples in Azure: Azure App Service, Cosmos DB, Azure functions.
SAAS - Software-as-a-service - cloud provider manages infrastructure, platform and software, and customer is just using the application. Examples in Azure: Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365.

## · What are the considerations of a build or buy decision when planning and choosing software?
When deciding whether to buy software or build it, these considerations should be taken into account:
 Cost - the costs of building and subsequent maintaining of the software need to be weighed against the purchase price, licensing costs, future support costs and customization expenses.
 Time - how long will it take to design, build and deploy own implementation vs. acquiring a commercial solution
 Software requirements - How unique are requirements for the needed software? If requirements are very special, building custom software might be beneficial, otherwise purchasing a standard commercial solution might make more sense.
 Development resources - is there sufficient planning, development, and operations talent to build, deploy and maintain the software?
 Provider reliability - if considering to buy, will the provider be able to support the software for the needed duration?
 Security - available commercial software should come with security certifications; implementing it on your own might be difficult
 Compliance - available commercial software should come with compliance certifications; implementing it on your own might be difficult
